    Simply connect with ssh and go play around with some commands.
    The teacher will be able to see all the commands you used !

    Actually this task will simply set result to success if some logs were generated!
    But of course as a teacher you may use these logs to understand what the student did.
    Or you could even automatically search for some specific commands in the logs.

    Note that the log file is easy to read in a terminal with a simple "cat" command.
    Here, the logs will be uggly printed as feedback for the example.
