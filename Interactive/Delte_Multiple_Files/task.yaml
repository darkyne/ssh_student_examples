    This times, there are many different files in the student directory !
    The correct files are txt files containing "save_me" in their name.

    We ask you to remove all the other files.


    -Connect with SSH

    -Delete, in the student directory, all the files which are not .txt or do not contain "save_me" in their names.

    -Exit

    Note: You only have 5 minutes so deleting files one by one is not an option !
